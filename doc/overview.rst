Overview of rubin_sim
=====================

The rubin_sim package consists of several modules which support the LSST
survey scheduler (`rubin_sim.scheduler` and `rubin_sim.site_models`)
and analysis of the LSST pointing history
(`rubin_sim.maf` and `rubin_sim.movingObjects`).
There are also packages which are just generally useful for
simulating Rubin Observatory sensitivity (`rubin_sim.photUtils`,
`rubin_sim.skybrightness`).

The rubin_sim package replaces most of the old lsst_sims packages.
