rubin_sim MovingObjects
=======================

The movingObjects module provides tools to generate simulated ephemerides of a population of
small bodies throughout an LSST pointing history. These ephemerides are typically used for further
analysis in `MAF </../rs_maf/index>` to evaluate the effect of survey strategy on various populations
of Solar System objects. There are several populations available in the 'orbits' directory of the
rubin_sim data.
