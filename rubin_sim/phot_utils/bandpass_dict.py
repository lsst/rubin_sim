    This class will wrap an OrderedDict of Bandpass instantiations.

    Upon instantiation, this class's constructor will resample
    the input Bandpasses to be on the same wavelength grid (defined
    by the first input Bandpass).  The constructor will then calculate
    the 2-D phi_array for quick calculation of magnitudes in all
    Bandpasses simultaneously (see the member methods mag_list_for_sed,
    mag_list_for_sed_list, flux_list_for_sed, flux_list_for_sed_list).

    Note: when re-sampling the wavelength grid, it is assumed that
    the first bandpass is sampled on a uniform grid (i.e. all bandpasses
    are resampled to a grid with wavlen_min, wavelen_max determined by
    the bounds of the first bandpasses grid and with wavelen_step defined
    to be the difference between the 0th and 1st element of the first
    bandpass' wavelength grid).
