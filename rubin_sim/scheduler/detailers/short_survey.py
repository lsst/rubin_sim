    ----------
    exp_time : `float` (1.)
        The short exposure time to use.
    nobs : `float` (2)
        The number of observations to try and take per year
    night_max : `float` (None)
        Do not apply any changes to the observation list if the current night is greater than night_max.
    n_repeat : `int` (1)
        How many short observations to do in a row.
    time_scale : `bool` (False)
        Should the short observations be scaled throughout the year (True), or taken as fast as possible (False).
