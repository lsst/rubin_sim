class DowntimeModel(object):
    """Downtime estimates, both scheduled and unscheduled.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config: DowntimeModelConfig, optional
        A configuration class for the downtime model.
        This can be None, in which case the default DowntimeModelConfig is used.
        The user should set any non-default values for DowntimeModelConfig before
        configuration of the actual DowntimeModel.

    self.efd_requirements and self.target_requirements are also set.
    efd_requirements is a tuple: (list of str, float).
    This corresponds to the data columns required from the EFD and the amount of time history required.
    target_requirements is a list of str.
    This corresponds to the data columns required in the target dictionary passed when calculating the
    processed telemetry values.
