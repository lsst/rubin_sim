    ----------
    XXX--update docstring

    self.efd_requirements and self.map_requirements are also set.
    efd_requirements is a tuple: (list of str, float).
    This corresponds to the data columns required from the EFD and the amount of time history required.

    This corresponds to the data columns required in the target map dictionary passed when calculating the
    processed telemetry values.
