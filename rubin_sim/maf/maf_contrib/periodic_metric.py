# Motivation: The detection of periodic signals can be examined by using canonical signals and attempted
# to recover these. However, a more general approach would be to examine the strength in signal that is
# lost as a result of poor phase coverage.
# This metric calculates the spectral window function for a set of scheduled observations.
# The largest peak at a nonzero frequency is used as a proxy to quantify how much power is
# lost to other frequencies. Full phase coverage will result in a value of 1.
# We refer to this as the Periodic Purity Function.
