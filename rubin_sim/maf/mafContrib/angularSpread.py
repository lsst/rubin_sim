    """Compute the angular spread statistic which measures uniformity of a distribution angles accounting for 2pi periodicity.

    The strategy is to first map angles into unit vectors on the unit circle, and then compute the
    2D centroid of those vectors.  A uniform distribution of angles will lead to a distribution of
    unit vectors with mean that approaches the origin.  In contrast, a delta function distribution
    of angles leads to a delta function distribution of unit vectors with a mean that lands on the
    unit circle.

    The angular spread statistic is then defined as 1 - R, where R is the radial offset of the mean
    of the unit vectors derived from the input angles.  R approaches 1 for a uniform distribution
    of angles and 0 for a delta function distribution of angles.

    The optional parameter `period` may be used to specificy periodicity other than 2 pi.
