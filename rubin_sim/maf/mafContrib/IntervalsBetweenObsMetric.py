# Calculates statistics (mean or median or standard deviation) of intervals between observations during simultaneous windows/Inter-seasonal gap of another survey.
# SurveyIntervals is the list of the survey observing window/Inter-seasonal gap intervals. It should be in the format:
# SurveyIntervals = [ [YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD] , [YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD] , ... , [YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD] ]
# We are interested in calculating this metric in each of the LSST passbands.
# The difference between this metric and the VisitGapMetric metric is that VisitGapMetric calculates reduceFunc of gaps between observations of a dataslice throughout the whole
# baseline, but IntervalsBetweenObsMetric calculates the gaps between observations during another survey observing window. This metric combined with surveys footprint
# overlap can determine how many often another survey footprint is observed by LSST during specific time intervals.
